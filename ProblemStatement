# 📝 Problem Statement: SatMil GPS – Tactical Drone & Satellite Navigation in GNSS-Contested Environments

## 🎯 Overview

Modern military and disaster relief operations increasingly rely on drones and satellite data for mission execution, communication, and logistics. However, these systems are often vulnerable to **GNSS jamming**, **signal degradation**, and **dynamic terrain changes** caused by natural or man-made disruptions.

This project addresses the need for a **resilient, intelligent simulation platform** capable of modeling tactical drone routing in compromised environments using:

* Satellite-aided routing
* Jamming detection and fallback systems
* AI/ML-driven terrain feature detection

## 🚨 Core Challenges

1. **GNSS Vulnerability**: Military drones often face **navigation failure** due to GNSS jamming or spoofing, reducing their effectiveness in hostile terrain.
2. **Dynamic Terrain**: Terrain changes due to **floods**, **landslides**, or **urban infrastructure damage** demand **real-time rerouting**.
3. **Limited Situational Awareness**: Most traditional routing systems lack integration of **multi-source satellite imagery** and **AI-driven map updating**.
4. **Lack of Unified Simulation Tools**: Existing tools either simulate hardware or routing separately — very few offer an integrated tactical + AI + telemetry simulation system.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Design and implement a **modular simulation system** that enables:

* Tactical drone and satellite **navigation simulation** across a customizable terrain graph
* Handling of **GNSS signal jamming** through intelligent **fallback routing algorithms**
* Use of **AI/ML models** to extract terrain features like roads, water bodies, and urban infrastructure from **satellite imagery**, and convert them to map data
* Visualization through an interactive **GUI dashboard** to monitor signal health, rerouting, and performance
* Logging and analytics of **telemetry**, **signal loss**, and **mission efficiency**

---

## 📌 Objectives

* Model and simulate **GNSS-jammed scenarios**
* Integrate **multi-source satellite imagery** into a routing engine
* Apply **deep learning** to identify mission-relevant geospatial features
* Visualize paths and telemetry using a **PyQt6 GUI**
* Extend to **dual-use domains**: military and disaster relief (e.g., flood zone detection and bypass routing)

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

This simulation platform can serve as a prototype for:

* DRDO/ISRO satellite-aided tactical planning systems
* Drone navigation in post-disaster zones (e.g., floods, earthquakes)
* AI-aided GIS decision support systems for public safety and military applications

## 📎 Deliverables

* Simulation engine with fallback routing logic
* AI/ML terrain detection module (roads, lakes, drainage systems)
* Visual dashboard with real-time route + telemetry monitoring
* Complete dataset (maps, logs, test cases)
* Technical documentation & project report
